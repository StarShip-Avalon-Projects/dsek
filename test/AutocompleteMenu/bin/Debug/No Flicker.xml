	<remarks>
		<para>
 It is recommended to call this method before doing
 any major updates that you do not wish the user to
 see. Remember to call EndUpdate When you are finished
 with the update. Nested calls are supported.
 </para>

 Calling this method will prevent redrawing. It will
 also setup the event mask of the underlying richedit
 control so that no events are sent.

</member><member name="M:No_Flicker.RichTextBox2.EndUpdate">
	<summary>
 Resumes drawing and event handling.
 </summary>
	<remarks>
 This method should be called every time a call is made
 made to BeginUpdate. It resets the event mask to it's
 original value and enables redrawing of the control.

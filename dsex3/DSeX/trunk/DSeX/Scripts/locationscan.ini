*List furre locations
*Written by Darvon Mitsumura
(0:72) When a furre remains motionless (doesn't turn, sit, stand or move) for 1 seconds,
 (1:620) and the PhoenixSpeak info {^4^={FURRE]} about this dream is equal to 1,
 (1:206) and variable %^2^.x is not equal to 1,
    (5:632) forget the PhoenixSpeak info {^4^=[FURRE]} about this dream.

(0:72) When a furre remains motionless (doesn't turn, sit, stand or move) for 1 seconds,
 (1:200) and variable %^2^.x is equal to 1,
 (1:621) and the PhoenixSpeak info {^4^=[FURRE]} about this dream is not equal to 1,
    (5:602) memorize that the PhoenixSpeak info {^4^=[FURRE]} about this dream will now be 1.
    (5:350) set variable %^3^2 to the X,Y position the triggering furre (moved from/is standing at).
  (3:2) at position (%^3^) on the map,
    (5:201) emit message {[FURRE] located at (%^3^2.x,%^3^2.y)!} to any furre present.

(0:31) When a furre says {^1^},
 (1:11) and the triggering furre has got shared control (or is the dream owner),
 (1:200) and variable %^2^.x is equal to 1,
    (5:200) emit message {Scanning already in progress, please wait a few seconds before trying again.} to the triggering furre.

(0:31) When a furre says {^1^},
 (1:11) and the triggering furre has got shared control (or is the dream owner),
 (1:206) and variable %^2^.x is not equal to 1,
    (5:300) set variable %^2^.x to the value 1.
    (5:200) emit message {Scanning dream for furre locations:} to the triggering furre.
    (5:350) set variable %^3^ to the X,Y position the triggering furre (moved from/is standing at).
    (5:50) set countdown timer ^5^ to go off in 3 seconds.
    (5:19) move any furre present 0 step(s) forward (in the direction they're facing) if there's nobody already there.

(0:50) When countdown timer ^5^ goes off,
    (5:300) set variable %^2^.x to the value 0.
    (5:19) move any furre present 0 step(s) forward (in the direction they're facing) if there's nobody already there.
  (3:2) at position (%^3^) on the map,
    (5:201) emit message {Scanning Complete!} to any furre present.

(0:10) When a furre leaves the dream,
 (1:620) and the PhoenixSpeak info {^4^=[FURRE]} about this dream is equal to 1,
    (5:632) forget the PhoenixSpeak info {^4^=[FURRE]} about this dream.

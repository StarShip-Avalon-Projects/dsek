*Target*
(0:72) When a furre remains motionless (doesn't turn, sit, stand or move) for 1 seconds,
 (1:600) and the PhoenixSpeak info {^2^} about the triggering furre is equal to 1,
    (5:350) set variable %^3^2 to the X,Y position the triggering furre (moved from/is standing at).
  (3:2) at position (%^3^1) on the map,
    (5:17) move any furre present to (%^3^2), or to someplace nearby if it's occupied.
    (5:600) memorize that the PhoenixSpeak info {^2^} about the triggering furre will now be 0.

*Join Furre*
(0:32) When a furre says something with {^1^} in it,
 (1:11) and the triggering furre has got shared control (or is the dream owner),
    (5:350) set variable %^3^1 to the X,Y position the triggering furre (moved from/is standing at).
    (5:601) memorize that the PhoenixSpeak info {^2^} about the furre named {[PARAM1]} will now be 1.
    (5:19) move any furre present 0 step(s) forward (in the direction they're facing) if there's nobody already there.
    (5:200) emit message {Joining [PARAM1]..} to the triggering furre.
    (5:50) set countdown timer 54 to go off in 2 seconds.

(0:1) Whenever somebody moves,
 (1:19) and the triggering furre (moved from/is standing at) position (%^3^1),
    (5:18) move the triggering furre back where they came from.

(0:50) When countdown timer 54 goes off,
  (3:2) at position (%^3^1) on the map,
    (5:201) emit message {Furre not found!} to any furre present.
    (5:300) set variable %^3^1 to the value 0.

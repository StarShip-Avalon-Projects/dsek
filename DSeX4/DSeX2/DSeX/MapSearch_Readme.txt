MapSearch is a console-based (no GUI) utility to quickly return locations of
objects, floors, and walls. The original idea was to provide something that
could be scripted to work with another application, but it's still useful
if you want a quick list of EVERYWHERE you use a given item.

==Parameters and usage==
MapSearch.exe [/ns] [/n #] [/f,/o,/w,/r,/e ##] <filename>

/n ## sets maximum number of returned results.
/f,/o,/w,/r,/e ## set whether searching for Floors/Objects/Walls/Regions/Effects,
along with which item number.
/ns removes application splash header.

[7:16:34 PM] Lothus Marque: Basically, I used the initial test regex I gave you, but added... uh, 
it's not in front of me but I think it was (.*) to the end. If it matches, add all the pieces together
 (except for the variable number) and toss it all at the function as a single string. The function 
 that does the movement takes two (I think, again, not in front of me) parameters - one is the 
 variable VALUE, the other is the string of commands. It then basically takes the command string 
 and uses a clipped version of the original test regex - just with the command+number. It tests for 
 that, processes the single match as it would for a single... then loops, matching/looping until there
  are no more valid commands in the list. Then the final coordinate is returned. :P
[7:17:32 PM] Lothus Marque: So you could have 30+ movements in a single replace point. I can't quite 
think of a good reason beyond maybe doing a spiral placement, but it's better than hardcoding. >.>

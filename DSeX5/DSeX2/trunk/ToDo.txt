(14:28:19)   Oxil: Just noticed one more little thing with DSeX. If you open it up, and then open 
an existing file, the new file tab stays there. Usually kinda pointless.
(14:33:09)   Oxil: Also ctrl-z works to undo, but ctrl-y doesn't redo, it seem you have to click the
 button for that one. Not a huge program-breaking issue, but everyone loves keyboard shortcuts.
 (17:04:17) Gerolkae: was curious what the redo combo was

(20:31:47)   Oxil: Wow.. I'm not sure what's causing this, but that's twice now I've been working on
 DS, and something while I'm pressing ctrl-z a causes it to wipe everything and leave me with a
  completely blank file. Undo doesn't fix it.
(20:40:58) Gerolkae: O.o

(20:46:15)   Oxil: Also on the ctrl-f window, just hitting enter doesn't work, you have to click the
 Find button. Just another little thing that could be made more convenient.
(20:48:04)   Oxil: And ctrl-f doesn't work at all to search for something like %temp or {share}, 
making searching for specific uses of PS info or variables quite unpleasant.
(20:49:20)   Oxil: Doesn't seem to work for anything that contains a non-letter character...

(20:54:17)   Oxil: The clear thing just happened again, as I clicked somewhere around the sidebar.
(20:58:47)   Oxil: Alright, still not sure as to the cause, but click around the area where the line
 numbers are shown a bit if you want to try and see what's going on. Seems to happen randomly.
(21:05:18) Gerolkae: Alright... Watch that Disappearing thing... Let See if we can find more clues to 
whats happening.. I'll be on the look outfor it as well.. thanks for the details on the other stuff
 too.. I had a feeling I was missing some Things...
(21:07:04)   Oxil: I just noticed the last couple time's it's happened, when I close the program, it
 hasn't even given me the "This file has changed, would you like to save?" dialogue. And the file is 
 apparently being saved because when I reopened them there were two lines.. I just lost a couple DS 
 files to that. Thank god for backups.

(21:49:12) Gerolkae: O.o
(21:49:34)   Oxil: Indeed.
(17:57:42) Gerolkae: is the Close Program Save thing happening every time or just random?
(18:10:47)   Oxil: The first couple times everything poofed, closing DSeX got me the save dialogue. 
Last few times it didn't. Not sure if I didn't anything different between those, but I don't think so.
 (18:18:22) Gerolkae: Ok Sounds luike I Fixed one thing and Broke another thing when I fixed the saving
 thing before...Thanks for the input I'll run some tess and see what I can do for this one.. Thanks 
 for testing and reporting the Issue... 

 (19:24:55) Gerolkae: When you closed the program.. where the Files Modified? 
(19:26:09)   Oxil: On the ones where I got the "Would you like to save?" thing, I just clicked no,
 and they seemed to be fine. The times I didn't get that, they were modified, and contained 2 lines, 
 I think it was part of the text that you find in a new file. 
 (19:27:01) Gerolkae: Um Did you Modify the Files or did DSeX do it on its own? 
 (19:28:53)   Oxil: It did that on its own. Deleted everything in the file as I was working, so I was 
 left with just an empty tab, but I could still work in it

 (19:31:20)   Oxil: Oh I think I just figured out what's happening. 
(19:31:29) Gerolkae: Oh? 
(19:31:48)   Oxil: It happens when you click a section. 
(19:33:00)   Oxil: Or anywhere in that area with the sections list.

 Hotkeys
 Ctrl+y Undo
 Ctrl+f Find Window
 Ctrl+z Undo
 * Causes a Editor Wipe and Undo doesn't work

Search&Replace doesn't seen to work for Symbol patterns... Suspect Regex Escape issue

Name=Bump Switches
Author=Lothus Marque
D1=This wizard script creates two sets of bumpswitches that will automatically flip when bumped by a furre.
D2=This doesn't cause anything else to happen at the same time.
D3=If you only need one switch, don't fill in the last two fields, and remove the *Northeast portion of the resulting code.
D4=This script is mainly aimed as a simple example to create your own Wizardscript.

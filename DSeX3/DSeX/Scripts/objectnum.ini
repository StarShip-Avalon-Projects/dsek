Author=Syphor Knight
D1=Create any object by speaking the comand and the object number. You must be shared to do this, however.
D2=(If you want to allow everyone to do this - not reccommended - just remove the 1:11 line from the resulting code) The object will be placed exactly where the furre creating the object is standing.
V1=Word to Activate
T1=Text String


[Code]
*Create any object! Just say ^1^ ##
(0:32) When a furre says something with {^1^} in it,
   (1:11) and the triggering furre has got shared control (or is the dream owner),
            (5:314) set variable %createobj to the number the triggering furre just said.
      (3:7) where the triggering furre is currently at,
            (5:4) place object type %createobj.

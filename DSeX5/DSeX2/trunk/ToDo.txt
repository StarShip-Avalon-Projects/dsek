(14:28:19)   Oxil: Just noticed one more little thing with DSeX. If you open it up, and then open 
an existing file, the new file tab stays there. Usually kinda pointless.

(20:46:15)   Oxil: Also on the ctrl-f window, just hitting enter doesn't work, you have to click the
 Find button. Just another little thing that could be made more convenient.
(20:48:04)   Oxil: And ctrl-f doesn't work at all to search for something like %temp or {share}, 
making searching for specific uses of PS info or variables quite unpleasant.
(20:49:20)   Oxil: Doesn't seem to work for anything that contains a non-letter character...

(20:54:17)   Oxil: The clear thing just happened again, as I clicked somewhere around the sidebar.
(20:58:47)   Oxil: Alright, still not sure as to the cause, but click around the area where the line
 numbers are shown a bit if you want to try and see what's going on. Seems to happen randomly.
(21:05:18) Gerolkae: Alright... Watch that Disappearing thing... Let See if we can find more clues to 
whats happening.. I'll be on the look outfor it as well.. thanks for the details on the other stuff
 too.. I had a feeling I was missing some Things...

(21:07:04)   Oxil: I just noticed the last couple time's it's happened, when I close the program, it
 hasn't even given me the "This file has changed, would you like to save?" dialogue. And the file is 
 apparently being saved because when I reopened them there were two lines.. I just lost a couple DS 
 files to that. Thank god for backups.

(21:49:12) Gerolkae: O.o
(21:49:34)   Oxil: Indeed.
(17:57:42) Gerolkae: is the Close Program Save thing happening every time or just random?
(18:10:47)   Oxil: The first couple times everything poofed, closing DSeX got me the save dialogue. 
Last few times it didn't. Not sure if I didn't anything different between those, but I don't think so.
 (18:18:22) Gerolkae: Ok Sounds luike I Fixed one thing and Broke another thing when I fixed the saving
 thing before...Thanks for the input I'll run some tess and see what I can do for this one.. Thanks 
 for testing and reporting the Issue... 

 (19:24:55) Gerolkae: When you closed the program.. where the Files Modified? 
(19:26:09)   Oxil: On the ones where I got the "Would you like to save?" thing, I just clicked no,
 and they seemed to be fine. The times I didn't get that, they were modified, and contained 2 lines, 
 I think it was part of the text that you find in a new file. 
 (19:27:01) Gerolkae: Um Did you Modify the Files or did DSeX do it on its own? 
 (19:28:53)   Oxil: It did that on its own. Deleted everything in the file as I was working, so I was 
 left with just an empty tab, but I could still work in it

 (19:31:20)   Oxil: Oh I think I just figured out what's happening. 
(19:31:29) Gerolkae: Oh? 
(19:31:48)   Oxil: It happens when you click a section. 
(19:33:00)   Oxil: Or anywhere in that area with the sections list.


(19:32:46)   Oxil: Just found an interesting little bug with DSeX's Find thing. If you type in 
copy into the box and click Find, the first result it'll show is      (5:10) play sound # to every 
furre who can see (#,#)., which doesn't contain the word copy at all 
(19:33:12)   Oxil: Then you cycle through to the end though and it doesn't show it again when you 
start the search over. 
(19:35:08)   Oxil: And now I'm getting a very odd error where every time I type a . it copies a 
portion of the line I'm working on and moving the text up a line, which is making it impossible to 
work on this since I'm using a lot of variable.x and variable.y stuff. O.o 
(19:36:39)   Oxil: This is in the version that's on Codeplex, by the way, not the last one you 
emailed me.

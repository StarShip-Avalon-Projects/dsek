(0:0) When everything is starting up,
            (5:212) set silent speech prefix (for spoken commands) to {!}


(0:0) When everything is starting up,
            (5:160) set region ^1^ to silent (furres can't speak there).

(0:32) When a furre says something with {!silence} in it,
   (1:11) and the triggering furre has got shared control (or is the dream owner),
            (5:601) memorize that the PhoenixSpeak info {silenced} about the furre named {[PARAM1]} will now be 1.
            (5:200) emit message {[PARAM1] has been silenced} to the triggering furre.

(0:32) When a furre says something with {!unsilence} in it,
   (1:11) and the triggering furre has got shared control (or is the dream owner),
            (5:601) memorize that the PhoenixSpeak info {silenced} about the furre named {[PARAM1]} will now be 0.
            (5:200) emit message {[PARAM1] has been unsilenced} to the triggering furre.

(0:32) When a furre says something with {!unsilence} in it,
   (1:11) and the triggering furre has got shared control (or is the dream owner),
   (1:78) and the furre named {[PARAM1]} is in the dream right now,
            (5:56) make the furre named {[PARAM1]} the new triggering furre, if they're in the dream right now.
            (5:610) remember the PhoenixSpeak info {silenceregion} about the triggering furre, and put it in variable %regionreplace.
            (5:350) set variable %position to the X,Y position the triggering furre (moved from/is standing at).
      (3:2) at position (%position.x,%position.y) on the map,
            (5:120) make this/these location(s) part of region %regionreplace.
            (5:200) emit message {You have been unsilenced.} to the triggering furre.

(0:1) Whenever somebody moves,
   (1:600) and the PhoenixSpeak info {silenced} about the triggering furre is equal to 1,
   (1:5) and they successfully moved,
            (5:610) remember the PhoenixSpeak info {silenceregion} about the triggering furre, and put it in variable %regionreplace.
      (3:5) where the triggering furre moved from,
            (5:120) make this/these location(s) part of region %regionreplace.
            (5:351) set variable %position to the X,Y position the triggering furre moved to.
            (5:320) set variable %silencereplace to the region number (%position.x,%position.y) is part of.
            (5:600) memorize that the PhoenixSpeak info {silenceregion} about the triggering furre will now be %silencereplace.

(0:1) Whenever somebody moves,
   (1:600) and the PhoenixSpeak info {silenced} about the triggering furre is equal to 1,
   (1:5) and they successfully moved,
      (3:6) where the triggering furre moved into,
            (5:120) make this/these location(s) part of region ^1^.        

(0:36) When a furre says or emotes anything,
   (1:600) and the PhoenixSpeak info {silenced} about the triggering furre is equal to 1,
            (5:350) set variable %position to the X,Y position the triggering furre (moved from/is standing at).
            (5:320) set variable %silencereplace to the region number (%position.x,%position.y) is part of.
            (5:600) memorize that the PhoenixSpeak info {silenceregion} about the triggering furre will now be %silencereplace.
      (3:2) at position (%position.x,%position.y) on the map,
            (5:120) make this/these location(s) part of region ^1^.
            (5:200) emit message {You have been silenced.} to the triggering furre.

(0:10) When a furre leaves the dream,
 (1:600) and the PhoenixSpeak info {silenced} about the triggering furre is equal to 1,
             (5:610) remember the PhoenixSpeak info {silenceregion} about the triggering furre, and put it in variable %regionreplace.
  (3:7) whereever the triggering furre was at when the trigger activated,
            (5:120) make this/these location(s) part of region %regionreplace.

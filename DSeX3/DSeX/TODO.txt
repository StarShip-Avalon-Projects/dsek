GoTo box Intermitten error


(22:56:15) Oxil: Go to line doesn't seem to work. Says the index was outside the bounds of the 
array the first time I try, and then just silently fails after that. 

(14:34:42) Oxil: No more crashes from Undo, but redo still gives an error. 
(14:35:09) Oxil: Oh, and you can only try to Undo 5 times before it gives an error too.
(14:36:36) Oxil: Found an interesting little pattern with the Undo/Redo thing. If you go 
through and undo until you get an error, then redo until you get an error, the undo until 
you get an error again, the number of times it silently fails goes up by one each time. 
It's like it's adding a value to the stack with each error.

(14:39:15) Oxil: Trying to find and replace still crashes if there's no tab, too. 
(14:39:31) Oxil: Same with saving.
